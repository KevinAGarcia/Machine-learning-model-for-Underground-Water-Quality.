# Machine-learning-model-for-Underground-Water-Quality.
Prepared and cleaned the dataset to explore tendencies and correlations in Python, Performed and analysis of Feature Importance through Decision Trees and Random Forest.

## About the project

The first part of the project consists of a database that corresponds to worldwide underground and superficial water. Once one of the options is selected there are certain tasks that need to be addressed.

 * Database cleaning. Explore each data (auxiliate of describe(), mean(), plot, pandas boxplot):
 * Identifying average, mean, and median central trends of the data.
 * Identify measures of dispersion, maximum, minimum.Identify non-central position measures, quartiles, outliers.Identify correlations.
 * Prepare the data.Perform analysis to find if there is a relationship between water quality and its geographic location through K-means.
 
Once the dataset is ready and prepared. The second part of the project is to select dependent X and independent Y for the column "SEMAFORO". SEMAFORO has three options that are referenced to the quality of the water which are bad, medium and great.

* Change the label encoding of the semaphore, eg, from ["class 1", "class 2", "class 3"] to [ 1,2,3]
* Perform a general analysis of important features through decision trees or random forest.
* Make your classifier, remember to divide the data in a balanced way (auxiliate train test split)
* Explore which classifier is the most optimal, example: decision trees Random Forest.
* Determine the degree of accuracy through the classification report https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html .
* Visualize model results or predictions through a confusion matrix.
